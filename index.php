            <h2>Big data</h2>
            <p>
              If your business is approaching or have already started dealing with big data we can help guide you through this jungle. Big data is not only a new buzz word but a reality that we all have to deal with sooner or later. Data are piling up every day and a lot of it is too valuable to throw away. Thus your business will have to find ways to visualize and extract useful insights and facts from huge amounts of data that are intractable to load for a computer. Even a fast one. We have developed a new big data frame work that allows us to capture your business’ specific needs and knowledge flow. In effect, we can in real-time display learnings from your big data setup.

          <h2>Pricing strategies</h2>
          <p>
            Setting the right price for your products should be determined by what consumers are willing to pay for it. Consequently, a simple price = cost + markup is most likely sub-optimal and should be revised.

          <h2>CRM</h2>
          <p>

          <h2>Sales drivers</h2>
          <p>
            Sales in any sector today are driven by many different variables e.g. seasonality, advertising, promotion, price, distribution, brand equity, consumer trust etc. The list goes on. Determining the volume for each factor is important as it can help identify bottlenecks, as well as untapped potential, in your sales strategy.

          <h2>Predictive maintenance</h2>
          <p>
            In these competitive times, the cost of a broken important piece of machinery can be devastating to any factory’s profit margins. The possibility to predict future breakdowns provides the opportunity to schedule replacement/maintenance of critical parts during low impact times. Green Analysts develop and maintain predictive models that monitor machine performance in real-time so that any identified deterioration and break down pattern issue an alert.
