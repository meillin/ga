        <div class="row">
        Setting the right price for your products should be determined by what consumers are willing to pay for it. Consequently, a simple price = cost + profit is most likely sub-optimal and should be revised. Continuously and consistently measuring and quantifying the effect of price changes on your sales provides an unbiased and objective estimate of your price elasticity.
        Price elasticity changes over time depending on, among other factors, seasonality, distribution, competitor activities, weather and brand strength. Therefor, the right price is also changing over time which means your business should try to capture this market dynamics to optimize profit.
