              <h2>Big Data</h2>
              <p>
                Big data is not only a new buzz word but a reality that we all have to deal with sooner or later. Data are piling up every day and a lot of it is too valuable to throw away.

              <h2>Pricing Strategies</h2>
              <p>
                Setting the right price for your products should be determined by what consumers are willing to pay for it. Consequently, a simple price = cost + markup is most likely sub-optimal and should be revised.

              <h2>Marketing</h2>
              <p>
                Effective marketing takes the analysis one step further into real consumer behavior by measuring the return on the marketing investment.

              <h2>CRM</h2>
              <p>
                Depending on where in the life-cycle a given customer is located they are triggered by different messages. Figuring out which message should go to which customer can be discovered and quantified through predictive analytics.

              <h2>Sales drivers</h2>
              <p>
                Sales in any sector today are driven by many different variables e.g. seasonality, advertising, promotion, price, distribution, brand equity, consumer trust etc. The list goes on. Determining the volume for each factor is important as it can help identify bottlenecks, as well as untapped potential, in your sales strategy.

              <h2>Predictive maintenance</h2>
              <p>
                In these competitive times, the cost of a broken important piece of machinery can be devastating to any factoryâ€™s profit margins. The possibility to predict future breakdowns provides the opportunity to schedule replacement/maintenance of critical parts during low impact times. Green Analysts develop and maintain predictive models that monitor machine performance in real-time so that any identified deterioration and break down pattern issue an alert.
